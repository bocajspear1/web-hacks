Web applications are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we use them on our desktops, laptops, phones, smart TVs accessing sites from search engines to wikis to configuring routers to games to ordering food to doing work. However, everyday web applications are hacked. We still haven't seem to figure out how to write good web applications. We store data insecurely and forget to clean up user inputs to the detriment of thousands of users.

So in a way, learning to hack web applications is easy. There's so many targets to pick and so many sloppy programmers out there. It can be fun to "rain on their parade" and simply them trouble. However, in this guide I want to look at both sides of the problem, breaking things but also fixing them. Hopefully this will give a better perspective into how these applications break and how they can be fixed. Hacking things is fun, but its more fun to find the issues before bad guys do and be part of the fixes that make the data of our friends and family safer.
